# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI-implement
Using Minimax algorithm, implement an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally.



## Understanding 
There are two main files in this project: `runner.py` and `tictactoe.py`. tictactoe.py contains all of the logic for playing the game,
and for making optimal moves. `runner.py` has been implemented for you, and contains all of the code to run the graphical interface for the game.
Once you’ve completed all the required functions in `tictactoe.py`, you should be able to run python runner.py to play against your AI!

Let’s open up `tictactoe.py` to get an understanding for what’s provided. First, we define three variables: X, O, and EMPTY,
to represent possible moves of the board.

The function initial_state returns the starting state of the board. For this problem, we’ve chosen to represent the board as a list of three lists
(representing the three rows of the board), where each internal list contains three values that are either X, O, or EMPTY. What follows are functions
that we’ve left up to you to implement!
